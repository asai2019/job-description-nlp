## Analysis of Data Scientist Job Descriptions using Natural Language Processing
***
This repository contains code to analyze data scientist job descriptions. Mainly, two different analyses were performed:

Objective | Description
--------- | -----------
1 |  Classification of statements within job descriptions into **responsibilities** and **qualifications** sections using random forest classification, with visualization of feature importance. 
2 |  Vectorization of terms related to job summaries using the GloVe algorithm for examining semantic similarity. Additional dimensionality reduction performed using multidimensional scaling.
